# NetrunnerDB Anki deck
Script to create an [Anki][1] deck from [NetrunnerDB][2]'s card database to
help you remember all the Netrunner cards.

Download the latest version of the deck
[here](https://github.com/nornagon/anki-nrdb/releases). You should be able to
import it over an older version of the deck without any issues.

Each flashcard's front is the name of the card, and the back is the card image
downloaded from NetrunnerDB.

I recommend suspending all cards but the core set (search for `pack:core2`),
and then unsuspending one or two packs at a time.
